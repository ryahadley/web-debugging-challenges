First started node server.js to check errors

1. Error numero uno... cannot find module 'express'.  there are no node_modules in this project, the dependencies are listed in the package.json file so I npm init -y the    project and npm install to download all the dependencies.


2. getting an error with express for the Route.get() requires callback functions.  copy and pasting the error in google to find help.  there was no express-session so I
  npm install --save that and had express use it.

3. keys is not defined.  made a keys.js file and added a secret.
