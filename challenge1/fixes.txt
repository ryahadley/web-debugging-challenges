1.  The first error I encountered was my angular Module was not available so I checked the app.js file to see how the module was set up and made sure
    all the dependencies were brought in and the syntax was correct for each state. I right away saw that each state was closed too soon with an extra )
    after the state name and no comma was there before the state object properties. As well as the closing bracket and parentheses for the module declaration.
    Put that at the bottom of the page enclosing the containing states and fixed the problem. Still getting errors.
    I next went to check the index file to make sure all my script tags were typed out correctly and that the angular cdn was brought into the project.  I saw a single missing closing tag for the url on the angular-ui-router. 

2.  Unexpected token ) logged in the console. showing productsCtrl.js:9.  went to my productsCtrl.js file and on line 9 there was no closing bracket } for the
    controller function.

3. Unexpected token { app.js:6
